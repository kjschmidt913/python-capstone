# python-capstone
Final capstone project for [Udemy's Complete Python Bootcamp: Go from zero to hero in Python 3](https://www.udemy.com/complete-python-bootcamp/)

## Project
Udemy has a document full of suggestions for the final capstone project. I have a few ideas and am finalizing the details. One of Udemy's suggestions is to put inspirational quotes over images. Currently, I would like to use a lyrics API to get lyrics to Arianna Grande songs and put them over inspirational images. I am still researching API's that make sense for this project.
